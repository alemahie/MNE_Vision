# MNE_Vision

MNE Vision is a open source software mainly based on [MNE Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html). We propose here a graphical interface for MNE, able to perform some of the most common tasks in EEG analysis and processing and available in MNE, while also proposing other tools.

The main objective is to propose a free alternative to [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) which requires a [MATLAB](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) license to fully work.
